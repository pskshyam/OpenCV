[image1]: ./img/output.gif "Counting Tetris Blocks"

This project covers below OpenCV bascis with Python.

* Learning how to convert images to grayscale with OpenCV
* Performing edge detection
* Thresholding a grayscale image
* Finding, counting, and drawing contours
* Conducting erosion and dilation
* Masking an image

To execute the counting_objects.py script, open a terminal or command window and navigate to this file and from there enter the following command with --image arugment:

`python counting_objects.py --image img/tetris_blocks.png`

To cycle through each step that is present in the script, make sure an image window is active, and press any key. You’ll see the output in terminal. I’ve also included a GIF animation demonstrating all the image processing steps that are covered, one right after the other:

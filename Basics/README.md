This project covers below OpenCV bascis with Python.

* Loading and displaying an image
* Array slicing and cropping for ROI
* Resizing image using OpenCV and imutils
* Rotating image using OpenCV and imutils
* Smoothing image using Gaussian Blur
* Drawing circle, line and text on an image

To execute the OpenCV_Basics.py script, open a terminal or command window and navigate to this file and from there enter the following command:

`python OpenCV_Basics.py`

To cycle through each step that is present in the script, make sure an image window is active, and press any key. You’ll see the output in terminal. I’ve also included a GIF animation demonstrating all the image processing steps that are covered, one right after the other:
